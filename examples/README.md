### A system is specified by using abc (attribute-based communication) calculus

We start from a given abc specification, from which

1. the translator abc2umc generates the umc model for formal verification by relying on UMC model checker

2. the translator abc2abel generates erlang code for actual execution by relying on ABEL runtime environment

As example, abc specifiations for graph colouring are provided in the
two sub folders.
