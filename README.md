* This repository contains models, code and tools for AbC developments used in the paper

** The two translators are provided in abc2umc and abc2abel, respectively

** The two execution environments are provided in UMC and ABEL, repspectively

** The abc specifications can be found in the examples folder.

* In our approach, we start from abc specifications

abc2umc generates the umc model for formal verification

abc2abel generates erlang modules for actual executions

# Requirements
